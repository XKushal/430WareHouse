Plan for project completion. 
1.	Thurs Feb 7. We will discuss sequence diagrams in class.
2.	Mon Feb 11. Conceptual class diagram for Project (1 per group) + use cases for all the main  operations (divided among group members; cover sheet due in class ) uploaded to D2L.
3.	Tues Feb 12. Cover sheet for use cases (word doc). Keep an electronic version with you for future ref. On the sheet indicate if there was unequal sharing of workload in the analysis part.
4.	Thurs Feb 14. Submit diagram of software classes (1 per group) in class.
5.	Friday Feb 15. Sequence diagrams (pdf only) completed for Stage 1, uploaded to dropbox, shared amongst groups members. Start working on code. 
6.	Tuesday Feb 19.  Code complete for Stage 1.
7.	Thurs Feb 21.  Reports for Stage 1 turned in (cover sheet for sequence diagrams and classes).
8.	Stages 2 and 3 should be completed and final reports turned in during the week after break.
General rules:
1.	A single person is responsible for any one artifact (be it use cases, sequence diagram, Java classes). Every group member should be creating many kinds of artifacts, not situations where one person deals with all artifacts for adding entities etc.
2.	Code written should compile and run on Centos (199.17.28.75).
3.	Final completed code (for each person, and for the project) should be in CourseFiles.
4.	The CourseFiles (on the Y drive) folders are labeled by Starid. Within your folder please create two folders: one with your last name (e.g. Johnson), and another with your group number (e.g. Group38). Individual assignments go into your named folder, and any assignment being submitted on behalf of your group goes into your group folder.

Stage 1 details  
Business Processes:
1.	Add clients (one at a time) /product (several at a time)/manufacturer(one at a time)
2.	Assign/unassign product to a manufacturer (supplier). 
Queries:
1.	Get a list of clients/manufacturers/products with appropriate fields
2.	Get a list of suppliers for a product, with supply price for each product.
3.	Get a list of products supplied by each manufacturer.
What is to be turned in for Stage 1 
1.	Use cases done by each individual in dropbox.
2.	Seq diagrams done by each individual in dropbox.
3.	Designate an author for each class to be created. The author designs the class (identifies all the required methods from the sequence diagrams and tests it (follow my sample code). Code written by each individual with Unit tests in named folder in CourseFiles.
4.	Completed code for the entire system (one per group) also uploaded to CourseFiles
5.	Cover sheet(s) for the group. The cover sheet should list the names of all the group members, and under each name, list the artifacts that the group member is responsible for. The artifacts may be use cases, sequence diagrams or software modules.
